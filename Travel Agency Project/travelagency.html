        <h2><center>The Legend of Chloe</center></h2>
    <p>The Myrtles is a haunted house that is said to have had 10 murders taken place there. One of the most famous stories is the legend of Chloe. Back then, at the time, Myrtles Plantation was owned by Judge Clark Woodruffe and his wife, Sara Matilda. Even though the judge was well respected in his community, no one knew he was a womanizer. The judge would always sneak around and have relations with his female slaves. He had a target of his advances though. His target was a slave named Cloe. Chloe did not like the judge having his way with her, but she knew that if she didn't follow through the judge would send her back to the toil with the other slaves. Once the judge found a knew interest, Chloe began to worry she would be sent back to the fields so she started to eavesdrop to see if her fear was true. When the judge caught her, he sliced off her ear with anger. Cloe knew she had to prove her trust so when she was in charge of the oldest daughter's birhtday party, she made a cake with a plant that contained a little bit of poison in it as an ingredient. She thought that if she nursed them back to health she would be trusted again. The plan went wrong and the other slaves began to worry that the judge would take his anger on Cloe out on them. The slaves decided to grab Cloe one night while she was asleep and hand her from an oak tree. When she died they cut her down, weighted her body with rocks, and tossed her into the Mississippi River. The house was then used as a tour atrraction, but the people taking the tour were not alone. A person took a picture and in the background was a shadow of Cloe. Chloe still haunts that house till this day. Want to hear more about the legend of Chloe? Click the link below.</p>
